## Introduction

It is derived from *TrinityCore* and *MaNGOS*, the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code of that projects with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
